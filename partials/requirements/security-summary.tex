\subsection{Technical \& Procedural Cornerstones of Security}
\label{security-summarisation}

The outcomes of the interviews were combined with the literature study to compile a practical list with security issues and solutions that are relevant in this project.
The list is described in table \ref{tab:security-list}, ordered by type and paper.

Furthermore, two checklists were found in the literature.
These lists give a number of points which a system should comply to in order to cover all identified security areas.
The first list describes items used to test the safety of an implementation of a patient-centred eHealth solution \cite{s17Dehling2014}.
This check list (Checklist A) can be found in appendix \ref{security-checklists-a}.

The second list describes questions used to test EHR systems on security and privacy \cite{s8FernandezAleman2013}.
This check list (Checklist B) can be found in appendix \ref{security-checklists-b}.
