			\cite{s3Herveg2014}	&	Personal data can only be used for the purposes described when the consent was given by the subject. \\

			\cite{s3Herveg2014, s15Fenz2014}	&	After the purpose described in the consent has been reached, identifying data should be removed from the dataset. \\
			\cite{s3Herveg2014}	&	The purpose of data usage should be: ``specified, explicit, and legitimate''. \\

			\cite{s16Ma2013}	&	Separate identifying data from the dataset, used in Ma \cite{s16Ma2013}  to optimise search algorithms. Non-identifying data is available for fast search, after making a selection identifying data is appended before outputting. \\
			\cite{s18Kum2014}	&	Hashes can be used together with (for example) Bloom filters to provide a solution to using identifiable data in data linkage. \\

%PROCEDURAL
%solution
%TODO: 6 Limited dataset under 45 CFR §164.514(e): 'Under certain circumstances, a covered entity may use and disclose protected health information (PHI) in a limited dataset for research, public health, and health care operations purposes. The privacy regulation identifies a list of identifiers that must be removed from data in order for it to be considered a “limited dataset”. Once removed, the information is not deidentified – it is still PHI governed by the privacy regulation. A data use agreement must be signed by those wishing to use limited datasets.'
