\section{Appraisal}
\paragraph{Strengths and limitations}
One registry as example (no branching to other domains). 
Limited time to program, thus less implemented functionality.
However, this example provides many different angles to approach the problem.
\paragraph{Comparison with existing systems}
Comparison with other existing software (OpenClinica, etc)
\paragraph{Future research and development considerations}
What functions need to be implemented to give the system an extra `boost'.
How can the system manage the expectations of users better.
How can the system better support users in their data management tasks.
