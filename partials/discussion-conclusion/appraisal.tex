\section{Appraisal}

\paragraph{Strengths and limitations}
This section will be split into two parts, there are strengths and limitations considering the system but also the implementation itself.
Starting with the implementation, the biggest limitation of the study is the limited time allowed for development due to struggles with data gathering.
Resulting in many design flaws in the front-end and minimal implementation of security features.

Features that are not directly visible in the front-end are not critical for a successful demo.
But a clean user experience with the system should be reached before pitching all the benefits of the system.
This will increase trust, where `invisible' back-end related functions can be expanded upon orally during a demo.

Even though the thesis contains a rather extensive research into security most of the found solutions were not used in implementation of the \ivfsystem{}.
Even now after the first prototype is finished it would not be advisable to start introducing these to the system.
First another iteration of function and design development should be ran before it becomes feasible to use intricate security constructs.
For demo purposes this is not a big problem as long as security issues and solutions are kept in mind before starting to use the system in a live environment.

While the system's prototype might be lacking it also shows what it is capable of after some more development effort.
In the evaluation users noted that the ideas of research workflow management can attract investors.
Value of an investment into data gathering is increased when sharing and reuse capabilities are added.
As found in the big data story these two things are vastly important in current day grant requests.

Next to these inherit profits of a system like this it also supports direct users (\ie{} researchers, data manager, committee members).
Researchers are currently supported along a big part of their research workflow.
While the data manager and committee members have an all-in-one system for communication and management tasks.
As said before with another development cycle this side of the system's potential can be fully shown.

When considering the system itself and how it is currently placed in one specific domain it is hard to tell how it will extrapolate to other domains.
Because the data model of the implementation is very flexible this should not lead to problems.
However, the set-up is currently that the dataset is fixed after system initialisation.
This implicates at least two things: there is no data input or edits, consent for data use is handled by the research committee.
Data editing and input are functional requirements which are easily implemented.
Consent and lawful procedures are quite the challenge and might change between domains.

One last limitation of the system is that for reuse only open-source software was considered.
This is also due to time restrictions.
However, the drawbacks here are that well implemented existing systems with functions like data gathering or data export were not considered.
Using these as building blocks in a larger cooperating framework might be more advantageous.
This would also mean that a gateway has to be developed to encompass all the different systems into one interface, otherwise this might rebuff prospective users.

\paragraph{Comparison with existing systems}
Multiple systems exist which perform data management functions these are amongst others: OpenClinica and DADOS prospective.
These systems were considered in the software reuse step because they are open-source.
Of course there are many more systems that perform about the same functions, where each of them will have a slightly different implementation.
For the sake of this section all these systems will be considered as Clinical Trial Management (CTM) software.

Each of the reviewed CTM systems at least provide data gathering and data retrieval functionality.
Most of them implement gathering with flexible input form creation which, after defined, are to be strictly followed during a certain trial.
Data retrieval (mostly) consists of a downloadable formatted file of the data, specific for statistical packages like SPSS.

For the goals we are trying to reach with the system this only fulfils a small part.
This especially became clear after the brainstorm which added many more requirements outside of the data management part.
Therefore the CTM systems may be used as a building block in a system like the \ivfsystem{} it will never wholly fulfil the user's needs.
Reuse of CTM software is advisable when the data model has to be well defined and supported (\ie{} many researchers use a specific CTM which proves that the data model is correct).

\paragraph{Future research and development considerations}
The \ivfsystem{} should be further developed and used in further data management research in the clinical domain.
In this domain a vast network of interweaving interests, guidelines, and laws exists.
Untangling this network should be the aim of further research into this area.
Research can be done on different levels: government and lawmakers, hospitals and clinics, or patients but also in different fields: ethical, technical, or social.
Furthermore, research into further development of the \ivfsystem{} can be performed.
Examples of research questions are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can clinician be persuaded to provide patient data for research?
	\item What type of technology can be used to improve data reuse considering patient consent?
	\item How should data be structured to maximise research benefits while making sure privacy is kept?
	\item How can user expectations for the \ivfsystem{} be managed?
	\item How can the system provide better support to users while they perform data management tasks?
\end{itemize}
