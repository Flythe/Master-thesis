\subsection{Technical \& Procedural Cornerstones of Security}
\label{security-summarisation}

The outcomes of the interviews were combined with the literature study to compile a practical list with security issues and solutions.
This list is described in table \ref{tab:security-list}, ordered by type and paper.

\subsubsection{Summary}
\label{security-summarisation-subsub}

Some overall points taken from this security analysis will be described and reviewed in the context of the \ivfsystem{}.

Consent is a difficult problem to tackle in research.
When it is required patients need to know what they are signing for and handling data outside of the procedure described is forbidden.
However consent can be avoided by using historical datasets for which it is unreasonable to acquire consent from each patient in them.
This last regulation is what the \ivfsystem{} leans on, which uses historical data.

In order to fulfil regulations and ethical needs a dataset should be minimised so that no superfluous items are left in the dataset.
For each of the data items in the dataset a purpose should be described. 
A proper purpose is leading in ethical discussions about whether to accept a data item in the dataset or not.
Having a well-defined protocol with the \ivfsystem{} can provide more confidence in the system by users.

For data linkage some identifying (\ie{} private) data items are needed.
This can be described in the purpose of the data item, but there are also methods for avoiding these data items.
Hashing of data with the application of Bloom filters make it possible to link two datasets without revealing the identifying data.
Data linkage is only mentioned as a future reference for the \ivfsystem{}, in the first implementation linkage is provided by external sources.

Anonymisation and pseudonymisation should be used to de-identify individuals.
While identification through data aggregation and cross-referencing is still possible to happen these steps should make it more difficult.
The \ivfsystem{} will use both techniques to provide privacy, datasets are mostly kept clean by removing all identifying data.
Whatever identifying data is left (through linkage) will be pseudonymised.

In order to decrease the chances of cross-referencing and data breaches in general provenance of data should be kept.
This means keeping logs on who uses what data at what point in time and what that data looked like at that time.
Apart from privacy this also makes it possible to keep people accountable and to provide data management functionality.
As the \ivfsystem{} is mainly a system to manage data this opens up many implementation possibilities.

Lastly, exploring and using present day standard security measures are a must-have for a good system.
During the software engineering cycle of the \ivfsystem{} searches will be done for the appropriate security measures for each part of the system.
Also the expertise of developers, engineers, and system administrators with multiple years of experience each will be used.
