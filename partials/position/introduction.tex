\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{Problem}
Describe data `usage' phases and what the problems are now:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Study preparation, data usage approval
	\item Data retrieval
	\item Data massaging/preparation
	\item Data analysis
	\item Data reuse
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Position}
There should be more data re-use and cooperation between data producers/consumers.
IT can help with the alignment of these two factions.
