\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{Problem}
Describe data `usage' phases and what the problems are now:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Study preparation, data usage approval
	\item Data retrieval
	\item Data massaging/preparation
	\item Data analysis
	\item Data reuse
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Position}
There should be more data re-use and cooperation between data producers/consumers.
IT can help with the alignment of these two factions.


%\silvia{the lack of time to implement the prototype is not well explained. i think somehwere in your thesis you need to explain the data collection to build the repository. the different formats, difficulty to access, etc. this was the reason why you did not have timein the end to do what we planned - because the data was not there, which would make the whole requirement analysis exercise too abstract and futile. this experience also comes back in your position paper.}
