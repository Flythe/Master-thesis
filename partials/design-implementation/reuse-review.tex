\subsection{Review}
\paragraph{In-house development}
What is it now = neuroscience data management and processing system.
Describe what Rosemary is and use that as a starting point to compare the other systems to (home-brew is our starting point in this).
\paragraph{External system evaluations}
Describe what systems were encountered and why they do not meet our needs and/or why Rosemary/home-brew was a better choice.
