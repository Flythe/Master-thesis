%Implementation

From requirement analysis the development moves on to the design and implementation of the system.
First the functional design will be described in section \ref{functional-design}, which is done by ordering the functions along a research life cycle story.
Then technical design decisions will be discussed in section \ref{reuse}, these concern reuse of existing software.
Lastly, the implementation details of the \ivfsystem{} prototype will be described in section \ref{implementation}.

For the software reuse decision multiple systems will be evaluated and one is chosen, namely the in-house Rosemary project \cite{rosemary}.
This project embodies the NeuroScience Gateway (\nsg{}) \cite{shahand2015data} which supports data management of MRI scans and processing these with applications on external computing services.
The \ivfsystem{} is the implementation of the requirements found in chapter \ref{requirements}.
For this study a partial implementation will be done through a prototype (referred to as: \ivfprototype{}) which reuses major components of the Rosemary back-end and front-end.
