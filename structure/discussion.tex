\begin{itemize}
	\item Section 1 overview:
	\begin{itemize}		
		\item Give short overview of all the chapters
		\item What are the findings for the security?
		\item What are the outcome of the functionality, data model, and software engineering steps?
		\item What are the outcomes of the cases?
		\item What are the findings of the evaluation?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Section 2 discussion:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Tie all the chapter's summaries together:
		\item How was security integrated into the functionality and data model.
		\item How was security and provenance accounted for, how does provenance help with security (auditing, which is also a function)?
		\item How was this reflected in the software engineering
		\item How was the system structured to help researchers, data managers, and PI's?
		\item Was this reflected in the outcomes of the cases and/or evaluation?
		\item What are the strengths and weaknesses of this study and this system particularly?
		\item What other systems were discussed and what were their strengths and weaknesses?
		\item How is this system going to help clinicians, researchers, managers, policy makers (government?)?
		\item What questions remain unanswered and what needs to be done on the system to complete it?
