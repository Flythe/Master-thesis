What data are we talking about in this chapter?

Description of the data, what is being collected now (PRN, clinics)?

How was the data gathered, what were the problems and solutions found here?

Description of Rosemary data model

What does the model look like on an abstract level (ER?)?

How it maps to the IVF PRN data, how does the data fit inside this model?

Planned implementation of the datamodel (minor changes to Rosemary datamodel, etc.) {might be something for engineering chapter itself?}

What is data provenance and how is it applied in this model?
